## Colophon

This site has been my online home for a decade and has been published under a variety of URLs. It's written in static HTML and markdown, and built on Jekyll. The current theme is adapted and modified from [Drew Devault.](https://drewdevault.com) It borrows much of the layout and design, but the liquid code powering the functionality is all written custom by me. 

I publish almost everything here first and use the site as my own sort of "social media" feed in addition to longer articles, projects and research that I share.
