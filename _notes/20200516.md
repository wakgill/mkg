Here’s a [great quote](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) from Adam Back on this back in the 90s:

> What we want is fully anonymous, ultra low transaction cost, transferable units of exchange. If we get that going (and obviously there are some people trying DigiCash, and a couple of others), the banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become. I think this would be a good outcome, and I'd rather see this happen than see anyone go to any great effort to get the banks involved. Let them stick to electronic "cash" systems (what a misuse of the word) based on credit cards and checks. See how that survives against real distributed electronic cash with transaction costs 10 to 100 times lower, with 0 red tape barriers to entry for both sellers and buyers. This is what I find interesting.
