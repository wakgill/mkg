[@nayafia](https://twitter.com/nayafia/status/1273304859387719680) I look forward to reading this and just pre-ordered. Incidentally, I've been so impressed with the quality of [@stripepress](https://twitter.com/stripepress) books. Acid-free paper AND sewn (albeit a bit tight) bindings in a sturdy hardcover. That's how hardcovers should be made—to last.
