[@jonasdowney](https://twitter.com/jonasdowney/status/1280620028774305792) Number 2. Good copywriting is everything in good design. Write your great copy [*before*](https://derykmakgill.github.io/drw/2019/06/28/lorem-ipsum.html) you do your designs and you'll often see you don't need to do much else. I was guilty of Lorem Ipsum designing for years before I learned this.
