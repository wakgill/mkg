07:40 < mkgll > I figured it out

07:40 < mkgll > they're communists!

07:40 <mkgll> damn smurfs

07:40 <r> why?

07:42 <mkgll> papa smurf is totally karl marx

07:42 <mkgll> all of the smurfs wear identical clothing

07:42 <r> dude you'd be the person in 1919 like burning russian people. hahahahahahaha

07:43 <mkgll> they have no currency, they all work for the benefit of the state

07:43 <mkgll> each smurf is labeled by their occupation

07:43 <mkgll> Farmer Smurf, etc

07:44 <r> hahahaha

07:45 <r> i guess

07:45 <mkgll> and they look towards Papa Smurf, the father, for guidance. Papa smurf is distinguished by red, communism

07:45 <mkgll> its a total utopian society

07:45 <mkgll> all of their mushroom homes are identical

07:45 <r> yuppp

07:45 <mkgll> no chance for improvment or extra mushroom additons

07:46 <r> thats debatable

07:46 <r> they can grow more mushrooms!

07:46 <r> its possible

07:46 <mkgll> but each smurf only has on shroom

07:46 <mkgll> one can only assume their brainwashed into not wanting more
  
07:46 <r> cant assume though
  
07:46 <mkgll> one can observe!
  
07:46 <mkgll> and Gargamel is supposed to represent evil capitalism! 

07:46 <mkgll> hes super productive, greedy, etc
  
07:46 <r> maybe they cant use more because they are magical mushrooms that have been there for generations that can no longer grow
  
07:46 <r> how is he productive?
  
07:46 <mkgll> hes a wizard!

07:46 <r> he fails at everything hahaha

07:46 <mkgll> hes a wizard!

07:46 <mkgll> he creates spells and potions

07:46 <mkgll> because hes a capitalist!

07:46 <r> yeah but they all suck

07:46 <r> so he represents the dangers because he makes potions and tries to kill everyone

07:46 <r> of capitalism*

07:46 <mkgll> yesss

07:46 <mkgll> and hes greedy

07:46 <mkgll> he wants to turn the smurfs into a potion to make gold
  
  07:46 <r> huh...
  
  07:46 <r> never thought of it like that
  
  07:46 <mkgll> smurfs are communist propganda!
  
  07:46 <r> bahhh
  
  07:46 <r> or its just a show for children and you can shut the hell up.. hahahahahaha
  
  07:46 <r> read so far in to things
    
  07:46 <r> "why you gotta get so smart on me?"
      

 07:46 <r> haha
        
07:46 <r> makes sense though
          
 07:46 <mkgll> its a show for children

 07:46 <mkgll> thats why!
  
   07:46 <mkgll> they want to turn the children into collectivsts!
  
   07:46 <r> look up the creators of the show
  
   07:46 <r> then research them
  
   07:46 <mkgll> "lets all be like the smurfs"!
  
   07:46 <r> then ill believe it more
  
07:46 <mkgll> I shall find it!
  
  07:46 <r> doo ittttt
